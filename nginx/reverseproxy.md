first ns to domain registerar. then park the specified domain names in that ip and forward it . then add specifed config file for reverse proxy to that domain name for ex.: par.conf to
/etc/nginx/conf.d  folder. then each site have one conf file in this directory . dont forget not to remove default site to manage error.

in my case i have to seperate domain name in 1 ip , then 2 file in that folder


also i install cert bot and add auto
